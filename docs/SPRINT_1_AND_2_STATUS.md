## 📋 Next Actions Required

### Decision Point 1: Sample Product Data ⏳

You need to choose how to handle product data:

**Option A: Create 30 products NOW (Recommended)**
- ✅ Pros: Realistic testing from start
- ⏱️ Time: 1-2 hours upfront
- 📝 Method: Seed script with Firestore batch write

**Option B: Create products as we build**
- ✅ Pros: Faster start
- ❌ Cons: Testing delayed

**Option C: Start with 5-10 products**
- ✅ Pros: Middle ground
- ⏱️ Time: 30 minutes

### Decision Point 2: Product Images

**Option A: Placeholder images (Fastest)**
- Use Unsplash/Lorem Picsum
- Generic beauty product photos

**Option B: Real product images**
- Source 20-40 actual images
- Upload to Firebase Storage

**Option C: Mix of both**
- Start with placeholders
- Upgrade later

## 🚀 Ready to Start Sprint 2?

### When You're Ready, I'll:

**Step 1: Create Foundation** (~2 hours)
- Create Product entity and interfaces
- Create ProductRepository
- Implement Firebase integration
- Create GetProductsUseCase

**Step 2: Create Sample Data** (~1-2 hours)
- Build seed script for 30 products
- Generate realistic product data
- Categories: Hair, Nails, Makeup, Skincare
- Run script to populate Firestore

**Step 3: Build Product List** (~4-5 hours)
- Create ProductListScreen
- Create ProductCard component
- Implement FlatList with products
- Add loading states

**Step 4: Continue with other stories...**

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Best path forward:**
1. ✅ Choose **Option A** - Create 30 sample products now
2. ✅ Use **Unsplash placeholder images** (fastest)
3. ✅ Start with Product entity and seed script
4. ✅ Then build Product List screen with real data

This gives us realistic testing from day 1!

## 🎯 What to Say Next

Just tell me one of these:

1. **"Let's create the sample products now"**
   - I'll create the seed script with 30 products

2. **"Let's start building the Product entity"**
   - I'll create the domain layer first

3. **"Let's start with just 10 products"**
   - I'll create a smaller seed script

4. **"I want to review the plan first"**
   - I'll answer any questions
